                2. Donate or request a donation or just explore the community to see how you fit in.<br>
                3. Anything is a donation. From life saving medicines to the unused copies lying on your shelf.<br>
                4. Donations are mapped as nearest-location-first basis to NGOs/beneficiaries who then distribute it to the needy.<br>
                5. The beneficiaries nearest to you, will be notified of your donation and vice versa, thus eliminating 3rd party logistics.<br>
                6. Once a beneficiary claims your donation, they can contact you on your provided mail-id.
