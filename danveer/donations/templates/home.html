    <p class="lead">Well its simple:</p>
    <hr id="how-it-works-hr">
    <p class="lead">
        1. Register yourself as a donor or a beneficiary and setup your profile.<br>
        2. Donate or request a donation or just explore the community to see how you fit in.<br>
        3. Anything is a donation. From life saving medicines to the unused copies lying on your shelf.<br>
        4. Donations are mapped as nearest-location-first basis to NGOs/beneficiaries who then distribute it to the needy.<br>
        5. Donations can be tracked and you can check if your donation was indeed distributed.
