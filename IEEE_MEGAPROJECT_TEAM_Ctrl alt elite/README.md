**IDEA**
In 2023, almost 700 million people worldwide lived on less than $2.15 per day.
Now more than ever, especially in countries like ours(India), people need to help the less fortunate.
However, realistically, the chances of an average citizen to seek out NGOs and go out of their way to help the needy,
is almost negligible, given how fast life is, and how scarce and of essence time is to people, 
even if they have something they are willing to donate or how kind or passionate they are about helping the needy.

"Daanveer" is a Web App aimed at bridging this gap between individuals who are willing to donate and NGOs.
The plan is to introduce an easy to use interface where people can simply discover what nearby NGOs or people nearby need
and talk to them directly about it, or just put out a notice about something they dont's need to be picked up as a donation by
NGOs nearby. 
**NOTABLE FEATURES**:
1. _REGISTRATION AND PROFILE_: Create an account and login as a Donor or an NGO/Beneficiary on the Daanveer website.
2. _DONATE/ REQUEST A DONATION_: If you have an item you don't need/ would like to get, Donate an item(Donor)/request a donation 
                               for an item(NGO), which will be displayed on the Explore page, for other users.
3. _EXPLORE PAGE_: All the nearby happenings and requests are displayed on one single page, for intuitiveness, where you can 
                   interact with them.
4. _GEOLOCATION_: Each user can input their preferred address, as per which, the donation requests/donated items will appear in 
                closest-first basis, thus making it more likely for the request to get accepted/claimed by a Donor/NGo respectively.
                This is further made intuitive by the presence of a map view of all the requests from your location right on the explroe page.
5. _ONLINE CHAT_: If you decide to Claim an item from a donor or Pledge to donate a request to an NGO, go ahead and chat with them
                about its details, discuss your deal/delivery on your own and the if settled, the request maker can approve the
                request on the click of a button.
7. _DISPLAY SECTION_: Recently made donations are displayed on the top of the explore page to motivate and ecnourage users to
                      donate.
